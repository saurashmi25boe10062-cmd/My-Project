Problem Statement
Current Process Inefficiency: The existing method for [Specific Task, e.g., tracking customer inventory or scheduling internal meetings] is manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error, leading to significant delays and inaccurate data.
Lack of Centralization: There is no single, unified platform for [Specific Data or Action], resulting in information silos and difficulty in generating real-time, comprehensive reports for decision-making.

 Scope of the Project
Inclusions: The project will focus exclusively on developing a web-based platform with corresponding mobile applications for Android and iOS. It includes modules for User Authentication, Data Input/Validation, Reporting, and User Management.
Exclusions: The project will not include integration with legacy systems, complex machine learning models, or external third-party payment gateways. Maintenance and support post-deployment are also outside the initial development scope.
Timeline: The planned duration for development and initial deployment is six months.

Target Users
Primary Users (Data Entry/Operations): Operations Staff and Field Agents who need to input, modify, and access data on a daily basis. They require a simple, intuitive user interface.
Secondary Users (Analysis/Decision Making): Department Managers and Executive Leadership who need to view high-level dashboards, generate customized reports, and track key performance indicators (KPIs).
Technical Users (Maintenance): System Administrators who will manage user accounts, permissions, and system configurations.

 High-Level Features
Secure User Authentication: Role-based access control (RBAC) supporting different user levels (Admin, Manager, Standard User).
Intuitive Data Dashboard: A single-screen overview displaying real-time summaries and critical metrics.
Bulk Data Import/Export: Functionality to upload data via CSV/Excel and export all reports in standard formats (PDF, CSV).
Automated Notification System: Email and in-app alerts for critical events, such as pending approvals or approaching deadlines.
Comprehensive Reporting Module: Ability to filter data and generate custom reports based on date range, user, and status.
